# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis — Power BI Project

> “Data doesn’t lie—but sometimes, it flirts before revealing the truth.”

---

## 📌 Business Scenario

Retailers constantly collect data on customer purchases — but most don’t use it to **drive strategy**.

This project simulates a **real-world sales analysis task** for a mid-size retail chain looking to:
- Understand **who their customers are**
- Identify **seasonal spikes**
- Align **marketing and inventory** with actual behavior

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed **retail transaction data** that reflects purchasing behaviors across multiple product categories and customer age groups.  
I used **Power BI** to uncover:
- High-spending segments
- Top-performing product lines
- Monthly and seasonal sales trends  
- Demographic-based marketing opportunities

This kind of analysis could help a real company:
- **Increase retention** by targeting their most valuable customers  
- **Optimize promotions** around peak spending periods  
- **Align stock levels** with seasonal demand  
- **Tailor campaigns** by age and product interest

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Power BI** for data modeling, DAX, and visualization  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Data Storytelling** through interactive dashboards  
- **KPI Development** for executive-level insights  

---

## 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset was sourced from a simulated retail case study during my training with **Quantum Analytics NG**.

It includes:
- Transaction-level data (dates, product categories, revenue)
- Customer demographics (age groups)
- Sales metrics (quantity, revenue, transactions)

---

## 🔧 Data Preparation Steps

Conducted in Power BI using **Power Query**:
- Removed nulls and invalid data  
- Removed duplicates using unique transaction IDs  
- Corrected negative revenue values  
- Created new columns:
  - Customer Age Segments  
  - Seasonal Flags  
  - High LTV Customer Identifiers
